# FIX 401 UNAUTHORIZED ERROR - ACTION PLAN

## THE PROBLEM

Your logs show:
```
‚ùå NetworkError: failed to connect to WebSocket: Invalid status code 401 Unauthorized
```

**401 Unauthorized = Your Azure subscription key is WRONG or INVALID**

Azure is rejecting your key. This means:
- Key is incorrect
- Key is expired
- Key was regenerated
- Key has spaces/quotes
- Key is not 32 characters

---

## STEP 1: Get the CORRECT Azure Key (5 minutes)

### 1. Go to Azure Portal
https://portal.azure.com

### 2. Find Your Speech Service
- In the search bar at top, type: **"Speech"**
- Click on your Speech Services resource
- If you don't see any Speech Services:
  - You need to CREATE one first!
  - Click "Create a resource" ‚Üí Search "Speech" ‚Üí Create Speech Service
  - Choose region: **Southeast Asia** (Singapore - fastest for Malaysia)

### 3. Get the Subscription Key
- Click **"Keys and Endpoint"** on the left menu
- You'll see:
  - **KEY 1** ‚Üê Copy this one!
  - KEY 2
  - Endpoint
  - Location/Region

### 4. Copy KEY 1 EXACTLY
- Click the copy icon next to KEY 1
- Should be **exactly 32 characters**
- Looks like: `a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234ab`
- **NO spaces before or after**
- **NO quotes**

### 5. Also note your Region
- Should show: `southeastasia` or `eastasia`
- **NOT** "Southeast Asia" (no spaces, lowercase)

---

## STEP 2: Update Supabase Secrets (2 minutes)

### 1. Go to Supabase
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ahexnoaazbveiyhplfrc/settings/functions

### 2. Update AZURE_SPEECH_KEY
- Find `AZURE_SPEECH_KEY` in the list
- Click **Edit** (pencil icon)
- **DELETE the old value completely**
- **Paste** the new KEY 1 from Azure Portal
- **IMPORTANT:** Make sure no spaces before/after
- Click **Save**

### 3. Verify AZURE_SPEECH_REGION
- Should be: `southeastasia` (lowercase, no spaces)
- If wrong, click Edit and change it
- Click **Save**

### 4. Verify Other Keys
Make sure these exist:
- ‚úÖ `AZURE_SPEECH_KEY` - 32 characters, from Azure Portal KEY 1
- ‚úÖ `AZURE_SPEECH_REGION` - `southeastasia`
- ‚úÖ `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` - starts with `sk-or-v1-`
- ‚úÖ `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` - starts with `sk_`

---

## STEP 3: Deploy Updated Function (1 minute)

```bash
# Deploy with validation
supabase functions deploy ai-call-handler-azure --project-ref ahexnoaazbveiyhplfrc
```

Expected output:
```
‚úì Deployed Function ai-call-handler-azure on project ahexnoaazbveiyhplfrc
```

---

## STEP 4: Watch Logs (Keep Running)

```bash
supabase functions logs ai-call-handler-azure --project-ref ahexnoaazbveiyhplfrc --follow
```

---

## STEP 5: Make Test Call

1. Go to your app
2. Create campaign with your phone number
3. Start campaign
4. Answer call

---

## STEP 6: Check Logs for Validation

### ‚úÖ SUCCESS - You'll see:
```
üîå Connecting to Azure Speech WebSocket (region: southeastasia)...
‚úÖ Subscription key validated: 32 characters
üîë Key starts with: a1b2c3d4...
üîë Key ends with: ...1234
‚úÖ Azure Speech WebSocket connected successfully!
‚úÖ Sent Azure Speech configuration with authentication
```

### ‚ùå FAILURE - Key Wrong Length:
```
‚ùå AZURE_SPEECH_KEY has wrong length: 35 characters (should be 32)
‚ùå Key value: a1b2c3d4...1234
‚ùå Please verify you copied KEY 1 from Azure Portal
```

**Fix:** You copied the wrong thing from Azure Portal. Go back and copy KEY 1 exactly.

### ‚ùå FAILURE - Still 401 Unauthorized:
```
‚ùå NetworkError: 401 Unauthorized
```

**Causes:**
1. **Key is old/expired** - Regenerate KEY 1 in Azure Portal
2. **Copied KEY 2 instead of KEY 1** - Copy KEY 1
3. **Speech Service is disabled** - Check Azure Portal
4. **Wrong subscription** - Check you're in correct Azure subscription
