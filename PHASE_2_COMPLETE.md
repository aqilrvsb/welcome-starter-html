## System Architecture

### Database Tables

**system_settings:**
```sql
- setting_key: 'pricing_per_minute'
- setting_value: '0.15' (or admin's value)
- setting_type: 'number'
- description: 'Price per minute for AI calls (in MYR)'
- is_public: true
```

### Admin Workflow

1. Admin navigates to **System Settings** (`/admin/settings`)
2. Changes "Price Per Minute" field
3. Clicks "Save All Settings"
4. Database updated via Supabase
5. All connected clients receive real-time update via subscription
6. All pricing displays update automatically

### Client Experience

1. User sees current pricing throughout app
2. Balance calculations accurate
3. Top-up amounts correct
4. Cost estimates precise
5. No page refresh needed - updates live

---

## Testing Checklist

### Admin Tests
- [ ] Change pricing in System Settings
- [ ] Verify pricing updates across all pages without refresh
- [ ] Create admin roadmap item
- [ ] Edit existing feature request
- [ ] Delete feature request
- [ ] View transactions with filters
- [ ] Test date range filters
- [ ] Search transactions by user/email
- [ ] View summary cards update with filters

### Client Tests
- [ ] View Credits Top-up page - pricing correct
- [ ] Check Dashboard balance minutes
- [ ] Submit Pro application - pricing shown
- [ ] View feature requests
- [ ] Make batch call - cost estimate correct
- [ ] Insufficient balance message shows correct pricing

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Admin changes pricing from 0.15 to 0.20
- [ ] Client's Credits Top-up page updates automatically
- [ ] Balance minutes recalculated correctly
- [ ] Cost estimates update in batch calls
- [ ] Transaction amounts reflect correct pricing

## Migration Instructions

### 1. Run Database Migrations

```bash
# If using Supabase CLI
npx supabase db push

# Or run migrations manually in Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor
```

Migrations create:
- `feature_requests` table
- `pro_applications` table
- `system_settings` table
- Storage bucket: `pro-applications`
- RLS policies for all tables

### 2. Verify System Settings

Check `system_settings` table has default row:
```sql
SELECT * FROM system_settings WHERE setting_key = 'pricing_per_minute';
```

Should return:
```
setting_key: pricing_per_minute
setting_value: 0.15
setting_type: number
is_public: true
```

### 3. Deploy Frontend

Code already pushed to GitHub. Deploy to production:
- Vercel, Netlify, or hosting platform will auto-deploy
- Or manually build and deploy

---

## Remaining Tasks (Optional)

### Minor Updates:
1. **StatsCards.tsx** - Update "Total Minutes" card
   - Currently hardcoded `stats.totalCost / 0.15`
   - Pass `pricingPerMinute` as prop
   - Quick fix, low priority

2. **AiConfigForm.tsx** - Display pricing in UI text
   - Currently shows "RM0.15 per minute" in info text
   - Use dynamic pricing hook
   - Display only, doesn't affect functionality

### Phase 3 (Not Yet Implemented):
- Deno Deploy Handler dynamic pricing
- PhoneConfigForm SIP removal
- Admin client password management
- Admin wallet management

---

## Git Commits

1. **Phase 2: Dynamic Pricing + Admin Enhancements**
   - Admin Transactions page
   - Admin Feature Requests CRUD
   - useDynamicPricing hook
   - CreditsTopup.tsx updated

2. **Complete Dynamic Pricing Implementation - Frontend**
   - Dashboard.tsx
   - PhoneConfigForm.tsx
   - useBatchCall.ts
   - ProApplication.tsx

---

## Performance Considerations

### Real-time Subscriptions
- Each client opens 1 Supabase channel for pricing updates
- Minimal overhead - only updates when pricing changes
- Automatic cleanup on unmount

### Fallback Strategy
- If RPC fails, direct query attempted
- If both fail, falls back to 0.15
- User always sees a price (never breaks)

### Caching
- Hook fetches once on mount
- Subscribes to changes
- No repeated API calls unless settings change
