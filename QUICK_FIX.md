# 🔧 QUICK FIX - Noise Cancellation Issue

## ❌ Problem Found

From your logs:
```
🔇 Noise profile calibrated from 160 samples
🎙️ User started speaking
[No transcription - call ended]
```

**Issue:** Noise cancellation was **TOO AGGRESSIVE** and filtering out your speech as if it were noise!

---

## ✅ Fix Applied

### **Temporary Solution: Disabled Noise Cancellation**

Changed line 255:
```typescript
// BEFORE:
noiseSuppression: true,

// AFTER (temporary):
noiseSuppression: false, // DISABLED for testing
```

### **Reduced Noise Suppression Strength**

When you re-enable it later, it now uses:
```typescript
// BEFORE:
NOISE_REDUCTION_FACTOR = 0.7 // 70% reduction (too aggressive)
SPEECH_THRESHOLD = 1.5        // Required 1.5x above noise

// AFTER:
NOISE_REDUCTION_FACTOR = 0.5 // 50% reduction (balanced)
SPEECH_THRESHOLD = 1.3        // Required 1.3x above noise (more sensitive)
```

## 🚀 Deploy & Test NOW

### **1. Deploy:**
```bash
supabase functions deploy ai-call-handler-azure
```

### **2. Test Call:**
Make a call and speak normally.

**Expected logs:**
```
✅ Twilio socket is OPEN, sending audio...
🎙️ User started speaking
✂️ Endpointing triggered - processing speech
🎙️ Transcribing audio...
🎤 User said: [your text]
✅ Working!
```

**If still not working, check logs for:**
- `⚠️ Azure returned empty transcription` = Still speech detection issue
- `🔇 No speech detected` = Voice too quiet or threshold too high

---

## 🔄 After It Works - Re-Enable Noise Cancellation

Once you confirm speech detection works, re-enable noise cancellation:

### **Step 1: Change line 255:**
```typescript
noiseSuppression: true, // Re-enabled with better settings
```

### **Step 2: Deploy again:**
```bash
supabase functions deploy ai-call-handler-azure
```

### **Step 3: Test in noisy place:**
- Call from street with traffic
- Should now work with balanced noise reduction

## 📊 Settings Comparison

| Setting | Old (Too Aggressive) | New (Balanced) |
|---------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Noise reduction** | 70% | 50% |
| **Speech threshold** | 1.5x above noise | 1.3x above noise |
| **Speech sensitivity** | Low (missed speech) | High (catches speech) |
| **Noise filtering** | Too strong | Balanced |

## 🔍 Why It Failed

**Root cause:**
1. Noise cancellation learned silence as "noise profile"
2. Your speech was only slightly louder than silence
3. System thought: "This is just 30% louder than noise = still noise!"
4. Filtered out your speech as noise ❌

**Fix:**
- Lower threshold (1.3x instead of 1.5x)
- Less aggressive reduction (50% instead of 70%)
- More likely to classify as speech ✅

---

## ✅ Action Plan

1. **Deploy NOW** with noise cancellation DISABLED:
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy ai-call-handler-azure
   ```

2. **Test immediately** - verify speech detection works

3. **If working** - re-enable noise cancellation with new settings (line 255 → `true`)

4. **Deploy again** and test in noisy environment

5. **Adjust if needed:**
   - Still too sensitive? Increase threshold to 1.4
   - Still missing speech? Decrease to 1.2
   - Too much noise? Increase reduction to 0.6

## 🎯 Expected Result

**Current (noise cancellation OFF):**
```
Works in quiet places ✅
Doesn't filter background noise ❌
```

**After re-enabling (with new settings):**
```
Works everywhere ✅
Filters 50% of background noise ✅
Doesn't filter speech ✅
```

**Deploy and test now!**

```bash
supabase functions deploy ai-call-handler-azure
```
